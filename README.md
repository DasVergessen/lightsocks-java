A fast proxy that helps you bypass firewalls.

At first, i planned implementing the shadowsocks protocol  which is widely used many popular tools  [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/) .  I found the AES encrpt/decrpt stream  will not end if the src bytes length  is less than 16  when invoke update method of JCE cipher (aes-cfb-128ï¼‰, this will cause some problems , the connection will wait for the rest data but it is cached in the buff .  By reading the [shadowsocks-go](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go) code  I also found shadowsocks handshake process designed  not good engough if the server could not reach the destination address  but the data has been transfered  from broswer to proxy client.

After some thinking , i decided to develp the tool using a new protocal  below:<br>
 *  the handshake should be ended not only the client and server have been exchanged  iv but also the server side has been           connected the destination server.
 *  each packet has two field plus .One is the validate length of encrpted data ,the other is the total length. This design has       much benefit when writing network programs.

### System requirements
 *  Java 7+ 
 *  maven

### How to build
```
On Server

mvn package -Pserver

On Client 

mvn package -Pclient
```
this tool is implemented by netty , you can get more information from [netty.io](http://netty.io),there is also a maven plugin [maven-shade-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/) for packaging the dependency  into one jar .

### How to use

Both the server and client tool will look for  config.properties in the current directory or classpath. You can use -c option to specify another configuration file. Download the sample [config.properties](https://github.com/lightsocks/lightsocks-java/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.properties), change the following values as you wish:

server.ip &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;server ip or hostname<br>
server.port &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;server port<br>
password &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; password used to encrypt data<br>
method &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default aes-cfb-128<br>
local.ip &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;local address<br>
local.port &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;local socks5 proxy port<br>

```
On Server
java -jar lightsocks-server.jar -c=config.propeties

On Client
java -jar lightsocks-client.jar -c=config.propeties

Change proxy settings of your browser to
SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:local.port
```
